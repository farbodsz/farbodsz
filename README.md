**Hi, my name is Farbod**. :wave:

I'm currently a 2nd year Computer Science student at [University of
Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs).  :computer:

Before starting uni, I was a mobile developer building Android apps and
libraries, including a [Student Timetable
app](https://github.com/farbodsz/TimetableApp) - you can view the repos below!
:point_down:

Now, I am exploring other areas of CS including web crawlers, command-line
interfaces, and web technologies.

You can find out more about my projects on [my website](https://farbodsz.net/)!
