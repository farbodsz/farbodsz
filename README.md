**Hi, my name is Farbod**. :wave:

I'm currently a 2nd year Computer Science student at [University of
Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/).  :computer:

Over the last 4-5 years, I have been a mobile developer building Android apps
and libraries, including a Student Timetable app - you can view the repos below!
:point_down:

Now while at uni, I am exploring other areas of CS such as web technologies.

You can find out more about my projects on [my website](https://farbodsz.net/)!
